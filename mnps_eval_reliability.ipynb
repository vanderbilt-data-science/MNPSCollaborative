        "This notebook builds off the starting point for the mini Hackathon with Metro Nashville Public Schools (MNPS) and the VU Data Science Institute (VU DSI). You aren't constrained to what is in this notebook, and please feel free to use your creativity to deliver the best solution\n",
        "\n",
        "## **1** | Overview\n",
        "* **Project Summary**: We’re checking whether the AI Assistant assigns the **right MNPS job title** (and major/minor role) when it reads a job description. We’ll use **a random mix of MNPS internal and external descriptions** from [New Sample_08.07.2025.csv](https://github.com/vanderbilt-data-science/MNPSCollaborative/blob/main/New%20Sample_08.07.2025.csv). For each record, the Assistant outputs a title and roles; then **a human evaluator** reviews the prediction and marks it right or wrong.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Our go/no-go rule is simple: the model **passes only** if—even after accounting for normal sampling wiggle room—its **true accuracy is at least 90%**. We measure that with a conservative 95% statistical check. We’ll also look at performance separately for **internal vs. external** descriptions and across **major role groups** (e.g., Specialist, Analyst, Director). We only exclude items with an empty/too-short Position Summary; other missing fields are okay because the model (and human reviewer) can infer what’s needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "  If we find recurring miss-patterns (like confusing seniority or over-weighting job titles vs. duties), we’ll **tune the prompt** and rerun. The notebook produces a clean adjudication sheet for the human reviewer, calculates accuracy with confidence intervals, and prints a clear **PASS/REJECT**decision.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Method Details**: Design. Prospective evaluation of an AI Assistant that classifies job descriptions into an MNPS top-1 job title (primary endpoint) and major/minor role (secondary endpoints).\n",
        "\n",
        "  **Dataset.** We evaluate on a **random sample** of both internal MNPS and external job descriptions from [New Sample_08.07.2025.csv](https://github.com/vanderbilt-data-science/MNPSCollaborative/blob/main/New%20Sample_08.07.2025.csv). The **only** a priori exclusion is records lacking sufficient text in the **Position Summary** field, which is required for adjudication. Missing or sparse content in other fields (e.g., Education, Work Experience, Licenses/Certifications, KSAs) is not exclusionary because those signals can often be inferred from the Position Summary or recovered by the AI model during classification.\n",
        "\n",
        "  **Model and Outputs.** For each description, the Assistant returns a structured JSON with: predicted title, major role, minor role, a 0–1 confidence score, a brief rationale, and a prompt version tag. JSON is schema-checked before scoring.\n",
        "\n",
        "    **Ground truth.** A human evaluator reviews each prediction. Where used for formal reporting, we recommend dual independent review with adjudication and reporting **inter-rater reliability** (e.g., Cohen’s κ≥0.75), but the protocol supports single-evaluator adjudication for prompt-tuning cycles.\n",
        "\n",
        "  **Primary outcome and acceptance criterion.** Top-1 title accuracy with a two-sided Clopper–Pearson 95% confidence interval. We accept the model if the lower bound ≥ 0.90. This rule is pre-specified and applied once per evaluation run.\n",
        "\n",
        "  **Secondary outcomes.** (i) Title accuracy by Source (Internal vs. External) and by Major role group, each with Wilson 95% intervals for readability; (ii) Major/minor correctness rates; (iii) Error taxonomy counts (e.g., “seniority misread,” “wrong job family,” “duties overweighted/underweighted”).\n",
        "\n",
        "  **Analysis plan.** The notebook calculates overall accuracy and confidence intervals, prints a PASS/REJECT decision, and exports subgroup tables and error buckets for prompt iteration. An optional checkpoint table reports the minimum number correct required for the acceptance lower-bound at common sample sizes. Prompt changes are versioned; re-tests are run on the full set after targeted fixes informed by the error taxonomy.\n",
        "\n",
        "  **Bias & limitations.** External job descriptions vary in style and detail; misclassification risk rises when licensure or scope signals are missing. To mitigate, the prompt explicitly weights Essential Functions, Education/Experience, and Licenses/Certifications over job title wording and brand terms. Results generalize to descriptions similar in content and detail to the sample.\n",
        "\n",
        "  **Reproducibility.** The notebook fixes the analysis rule (exact 95% CI lower-bound ≥0.90), logs (record_id, prompt_version, model_json, timestamp), exports the human adjudication sheet and scored results, and supports re-runs with updated prompts."
